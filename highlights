I'll add edit and delete icons to each saved highlight in the "View Highlights" section. Here's the updated version:

I've added edit and delete functionality to the highlights with intuitive icons:

### New Features:

1. **Edit Button (‚úèÔ∏è)**
   - Each saved highlight now has a pencil icon button
   - Clicking it opens a popup where you can edit the note
   - Changes are saved to localStorage when you click "Save"

2. **Delete Button (üóëÔ∏è)**
   - Each saved highlight now has a trash can icon button
   - Clicking it immediately removes the highlight from both the list and the text
   - The highlight is also removed from localStorage

3. **Improved Interface**
   - Both buttons are clearly visible next to each highlight in the "My Highlights and Notes" section
   - Styled as round buttons that stand out against the highlight background
   - Tooltips appear when hovering over the buttons to explain their function

4. **Streamlined Editing Experience**
   - The edit popup is centered on screen for easy access
   - Current note text is pre-populated in the edit field
   - Simple save/cancel buttons for completing the edit

The implementation keeps the clean, simple interface while adding these important management features. All highlights and notes are still saved to localStorage, so they'll persist between sessions.

This should provide a complete highlighting experience similar to what you'd find in professional ePub readers, with the ability to not only create highlights and notes but also manage them effectively.
